# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

   # t.string   "name"
   #  t.text     "description"
   #  t.integer  "price_in_cents"
   #  t.datetime "created_at"
   #  t.datetime "updated_at"
   #  t.string   "image"
   #  t.string   "pic"
# Product.create([
# 	{name: "", description: "", price_in_cents: 1, pic: ""},
# 	{name: "", description: "", price_in_cents: 1, pic: ""}
